# String Substitution Systems
This little work is inspired by a wonderful Wolfram Physics [Project](https://www.wolframphysics.org/)  

Very simple system of objects and rules may produce incredibly complex behavior.  
Here we will illustrate just [one aspect](https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/string-substitution-systems/#p-201) of this fascinating topic, using multiple programming languages.
## Brief explanation
If we start with the letter A and apply the simplest rules for replacing elements,  
it is possible to get results of many types:
- Fixed point:
{A → A}  A ⟶ A
- Growth:
{A → AA}  A ⟶ AA ⟶ AAA ⟶ ...
- Loop:
{A → AA}  A ⟶ AA ⟶ AAA ⟶ ...
- Fractal:
{"A" -> "AB", "B" -> "AA"}
